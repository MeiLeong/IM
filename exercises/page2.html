    <h1> This is the anatomy of a Pet</h1>
    <strong>We will start with the Neck.</strong> <br>A microchip is inserted between the base of the neck and the
    top of the shoulder blades.<br> The neck can be scanned using a handheld scanner (network) to retrieve the data from
    the chip.
    <br>
    <br>
    Microchipping allows humans to store information about their pets, within the animal’s own body. The Microchip has
    an individual identifier, which can be used to lookup the owner’s information in a Pet registry database.
