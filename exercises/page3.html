        <strong>We start with the Body</strong><br>
         "The body of the instrument is made from three cathode-ray tubes installed inside acrylic boxes that also support
         a cello bridge, tailpiece and strings" <br> <i>Art Gallery of NSW</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        The original TV Cello was created for celloist Charlotte Moorman to perform. Moorman played the instrument by
        plucking strings and tapping the acrylic box to create sound. Throughout his career, Paik created Ten versions
        of TV Cello.
